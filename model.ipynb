When he arrived at the main hall, there was a scholarly looking middle-aged man in his mid-thirties dressed in a white robe, sitting on the head seat. Next to him was a pretty woman. This married couple was Huang Xiaolong‚Äôs parents in this life: his father Huang Peng, and his mother, Su Yan. \\n \"Dad, Mom, you were looking for me?\" Huang Xiaolong asked as he walked into the hall. \\n Huang Peng raised his sharp, sword-like brows: \"Where did you run off to so early in the morning?\" \\n \"It‚Äôs fine. Don‚Äôt frighten the child.\" Su Yan interjected with a smile: \"Long‚Äôer, in a few days you will be seven years old. It‚Äôs about time to awaken the Martial spirit in your body. Your father and I are planning to bring you over to the Martial Hall for the awakening ceremony.‚Äù \\n Martial spirit awakening? Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment. \\n In this world, humans have an existence termed as martial spirits in their body. Human warriors‚Äô strength was closely related to the talents of these martial spirits, and they were graded into low, average, and high; martial spirits graded ten and above were considered as superb talent martial spirits, a heaven-defying existence. The higher one‚Äôs talent, the better it was for their body to absorb the world‚Äôs spiritual energy and become a strong Warrior. \\n Nevertheless, there were also people born without martial spirits and also those that had crippled martial spirits, rendering them unable to train. In Martial Spirit World, these people were labeled as wastes! \\n Martial spirits... A light flashed across Huang Xiaolong‚Äôs eyes for he too wanted to know if he possessed any martial spirit in his body, and if he does, what martial spirit would it be? \\n Thus, Huang Xiaolong was led by Su Yan and Huang Peng to the Martial Hall of the Huang Clan Manor. When they arrived at the outer area of the sacred hall, it was already packed with people waiting with their children wanting to awaken their martial spirits. Other than Huang Xiaolong, there were also other brothers of the Huang Clan Manor who were present. \\n ... \\n An imposing middle-aged man stood in the center of the Martial Hall; he had a square face and thick, dense eyebrows, and emanated an oppressive aura. This man was Huang Peng‚Äôs older brother, Huang Ming. He was also Huang Xiaolong‚Äôs Eldest Uncle. Next to Huang Ming stood a boy the same age as Huang Xiaolong; Eldest Uncle Huang Ming‚Äôs second son, Huang Wei, who was also here for the martial spirit awakening ceremony. \\n Huang Peng and Su Yan led Huang Xiaolong to the center of the hall. Greeting Huang Ming, Huang Peng called out: \"Big Brother.‚Äù \\n Huang Xiaolong followed in their greeting and called out: ‚ÄúEldest Uncle.‚Äù \\n When Huang Ming saw it was Huang Peng and Su Yan, his expressionless deadpan face loosened slightly, he nodded lightly and said: \"You‚Äôre here.\"', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=3092, end_char_idx=6587, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.5559023207278778), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='beaa2bf3-eaad-4bd6-a94d-41c8368776be', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'd:\\\\Computer Science\\\\biddies\\\\data\\\\test.txt', 'file_name': 'test.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 10785, 'creation_date': '2024-06-21', 'last_modified_date': '2023-11-30'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1e226f97-076a-4aef-abad-fef7674ffb75', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': 'd:\\\\Computer Science\\\\biddies\\\\data\\\\test.txt', 'file_name': 'test.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 10785, 'creation_date': '2024-06-21', 'last_modified_date': '2023-11-30'}, hash='779487efe29c5d79f2d2195a7e5f3fd87ad184ca3f6c4fbba738b402209581ab'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f8e743ed-6c69-457d-aff5-c3eea3dd53fc', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='2c1ec07cb16069a345dc12f964c9d7f3a77c1e614698984b334a591d95e4adfa')}, text='Chapter 01: Wind Snow Continent \\n Night slowly settled in a quiet manner and bright stars began to appear. \\n On the hillside, a child about six years old was standing in a strange position. The child‚Äôs feet were stretched apart, toes touching the ground with the heels lifted, hands raised high above the head, his head tilted up, and faint spiritual energy constantly circled within his small body. \\n Moonlight shone down, enveloping the child‚Äôs body. \\n The boy continued his practice in this bizarre position, inhaling spiritual energy into his body, letting it flow along his meridians. \\n Night slowly passed. \\n As the moonlight faded, replaced by the first rays of sunshine, the child slowly lowered his palms. His eyes opened to reveal deep, dark pupils that seemed to have a sharp golden glint deep within them. \\n Huang Xiaolong breathed out a mouthful of foul air, his eyes staring at the rising sun. From the day he was born to the present day, it had been seven years since he came to this world. He started practicing the Body Metamorphose Scripture at the age of three. Now four years later, he had managed to reach the Third Stage: Palm Propping the Sky Gate. \\n In his previous life, his ancestors had trained under the banner of the Shaolin Temple and the Body Metamorphose Scripture was an inheritance from his ancestors. Until now, Huang Xiaolong had been unable to understand the reason why someone like him, who was hailed as a martial arts prodigy in his time, was brought to this world. \\n And the matter that depressed Huang Xiaolong the most was that he awoke in the body of a newborn baby. \\n Huang Xiaolong looked at his small thin arms and smiled sourly. He had reached the age of seventeen in his previous life, and after fourteen years of hard work, he had managed to train in the Body Metamorphose Scripture up to the Ninth stage, but never could he have imagined that he would have to start all over again. \\n At this moment, Huang Xiaolong heard the soft rustle of footsteps coming from the direction of the hillside. Huang Xiaolong knew who it was without having to look over his shoulder and sure enough, soon a tender, childlike voice cried out: \"Big Brother, I know that you are here to see the sunrise. Dad and Mom are looking for you.‚Äù \\n Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder and saw a lovely little five-year-old girl with big round eyes and hair braided into two long braids, trekking up the small hill. This little girl was Huang Xiaolong‚Äôs sister, Huang Min. \\n Other than Huang Min, Huang Xiaolong had another brother, three years younger than him named Huang Xiaohai. \\n \"Mom and Dad are looking for me?\" Huang Xiaolong asked. \"What is the matter?\" \\n \"I don‚Äôt know.\" Huang Min‚Äôs voice was laced with innocence, \"Brother, let‚Äôs go back. If we are late, then Mom and Dad will spank your backside!‚Äù \\n When Huang Xiaolong heard this, he smiled and squeezed Huang Min‚Äôs cute little cheeks before saying, \"Let‚Äôs go then,\" \\n Huang Min rubbed the spot where Huang Xiaolong had pinched her little face, pouted then said sulkily: \"Brother, you are truly hateful. I have told you, don‚Äôt pinch my cheeks!‚Äù \\n However, just as Huang Min finished speaking, her cheeks were once again pinched by Huang Xiaolong, who laughed heartily as he made his escape. Huang Min chased after him screaming, trying to catch up. \\n \"Brother, don‚Äôt run!\" \\n The siblings frolicked all the way down the hill until they had made their way back to the Huang Clan Manor situated at the foothills. \\n Although he was already seventeen in his previous life, being with his sister Huang Min brought out the child in him.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=1, end_char_idx=3617, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.5531139535600709)], metadata={'f8e743ed-6c69-457d-aff5-c3eea3dd53fc': {'file_path': 'd:\\\\Computer Science\\\\biddies\\\\data\\\\test.txt', 'file_name': 'test.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 10785, 'creation_date': '2024-06-21', 'last_modified_date': '2023-11-30'}, 'beaa2bf3-eaad-4bd6-a94d-41c8368776be': {'file_path': 'd:\\\\Computer Science\\\\biddies\\\\data\\\\test.txt', 'file_name': 'test.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 10785, 'creation_date': '2024-06-21', 'last_modified_date': '2023-11-30'}})"
